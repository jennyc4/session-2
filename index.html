    <h1>Cut to the Feeling<h2>- Carly Rae Jepsen</h2></h1>
    
    <p><h3>L'artiste</h3></p>
    <p><strong>Carly Rae Jepsen</strong>'s breakthrough came in 2012 with her second studio album, <em>Kiss</em>, which marked a greater shift into mainstream pop music and was a moderate seller worldwide. Its single "Call Me Maybe" became a viral sensation, reaching number one in 18 countries and culminating as the year's best-selling single globally. Jepsen took a brief hiatus from the music industry soon thereafter, making her Broadway debut as the titular character in <em>Cinderella</em>. Jepsen's third studio album <em>Emotion</em> (2015) is noted for blending her synthpop sound with "indie sensibilities". It was released to critical laudation and grew to become a cult favorite, attracting a more mature audience to her music. </p>

    <p><h2>Les paroles</h2></p>
    I had a dream, or was it real?<br />
  We crossed the line and it was on<br />
(We crossed the line, it was on this time)<br />
I've been denying how I feel<br />
You've been denying what you want<br />
(You want from me, talk to me baby)<br />
I want some satisfaction, take me to the stars<br />
A-a-ahhh!<br />

<br>I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling<br />
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone<br />
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah<br />
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah<br />
I wanna play where you play with the angels<br />
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh<br />
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah<br />
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah<br />


<br>Cancel your reservations<br />
No more hesitations, this is on<br />
(Can't make it stop, give me all you got)<br />
I want it all or nothing<br />
No more in-between, now give your<br />
(Everything to me, let's get real baby)<br />
 

<br>A chemical reaction, take me in your arms<br />
And make me, "ahhh"<br />
A-a-ahhh!<br />

<br>I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling<br />
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone<br />
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah<br />
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah<br />
I wanna play where you play with the angels<br />
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh<br />
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah<br />
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah<br />


<br>Take me to emotion, I want to go all the way<br />
Show me devotion and take me all the way<br />
Take me to emotion, I want to go all the way<br />
Show me devotion and take me all the way<br />
All the way, all the way, all the way<br />
Take me all the way, a-a-ahhh!<br />


<br>I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling<br />
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone<br />
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah<br />
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah<br />
I wanna play where you play with the angels<br />
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh<br />
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah<br />
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah</p>
