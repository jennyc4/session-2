    <h1>Cut to the Feeling<h2>- Carly Rae Jepsen</h2></h1>
    
    <p><h3>L'artiste</h3></p>
    <p>Carly Rae Jepsen's breakthrough came in 2012 with her second studio album, Kiss, which marked a greater shift into mainstream pop music and was a moderate seller worldwide. Its single "Call Me Maybe" became a viral sensation, reaching number one in 18 countries and culminating as the year's best-selling single globally. Jepsen took a brief hiatus from the music industry soon thereafter, making her Broadway debut as the titular character in Cinderella. Jepsen's third studio album Emotion (2015) is noted for blending her synthpop sound with "indie sensibilities". It was released to critical laudation and grew to become a cult favorite, attracting a more mature audience to her music. </p>

    <p><h2>Les paroles</h2></p>
    I had a dream, or was it real?<br />
  We crossed the line and it was on<br />
(We crossed the line, it was on this time)<br />
I've been denying how I feel<br />
You've been denying what you want<br />
(You want from me, talk to me baby)<br />
I want some satisfaction, take me to the stars<br />
A-a-ahhh!<br />


I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah


Cancel your reservations
No more hesitations, this is on
(Can't make it stop, give me all you got)
I want it all or nothing
No more in-between, now give your
(Everything to me, let's get real baby)
 


A chemical reaction, take me in your arms
And make me, "ahhh"
A-a-ahhh!

I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah


Take me to emotion, I want to go all the way
Show me devotion and take me all the way
Take me to emotion, I want to go all the way
Show me devotion and take me all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way
Take me all the way, a-a-ahhh!


I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah</p>
